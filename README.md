The delivarable for my MSc dissertation. A platform for general practitioners to keep contact with patients. This application was created to improve mental attitudes
towards GP and hospital appointments whilst maintaining a degree of privacy.

The application allows general practitioners to maintain control of the contact they are receiving from patients through the chat code system giving the practitioner
full control and allowing for increased privacy and reduced harrassment. In turn allowing the patient to contact their practitioner prior to any appointments if the
practitioner wishes to allow them to do so, majorly in attempts to quell any pre-appointment/surgery anxiety.
